# Yottly Frontend Entry Task

The goal of the task is to implement a simple single page application.
This application will present a few basic UI components and their usage examples.

## Functional requirements
Implement 5 basic UI components:
1) Button
2) Text Input
3) Checkbox
4) Dialog/Modal
5) Tooltip

Design highly usable public interface of these components. You may want to look at some existing design systems for inspiration. Implement and style these components according to your best judgement. Implement the presentation wrapper for the end user to be able to browse through those components and their various states.

## Technical requirements
Write the application in **JavaScript**, on top of the **Node.js**, using **React** framework. Any open-source module that doesn't solve the core functionality of the app may be used. Focus on the components' interface and clean code - components should be **reusable, extendible and easy to maintain**. Style the components using **CSS** along with some pre-processing engine (Sass, Less, Stylus...). Structure your app properly so the individual components can be added/modified/removed easily. Create a repository on GitHub, share it with us and commit as you progress. As a presentation wrapper we recommend to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Bonus points
Following features are optional but welcomed:
1) Use **TypeScript** instead of JavaScript. In that case, type all interfaces used, especially components' props.
2) Create at least one **test** for each component.

## Contact
If you struggle, you can contact us anytime and we will provide more information. Also if you stuck at one point, just try to implement the rest of functionality.

Good luck and have fun!
